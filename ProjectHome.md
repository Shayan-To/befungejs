This is a JavaScript implementation of the [Befunge](http://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge) language. This was written in a similar vein to the [BrainFsck](http://code.google.com/p/bf-javascript/) JavaScript utilities that I created to test the JIT JavaScript Compilers now present in modern web browsers.

This test is not nearly as well-developed as the BrainFsck utilities, but it was a fun experiment.
